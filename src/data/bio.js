export const bio = [` I have a passion for problem-solving. I love to troubleshoot anything from
 software to electronics to automobiles and more! After nearly 20 years in the automotive industry,
  I have re-directed my career toward software and web development.`,
` I grew up in the town of Arden, Delaware, a town full of artisans and craftspeople. There I
 learned to think outside the box and that anything can be made with the right tools. Now I am 
 filling my toolbox to work with a new medium, coding. I started with the desire to build my 
 own video game and spent hundreds of hours learning the language and the fundamentals of 
 programming. Once I had learned a good amount, I decided that I wanted to work on something more
  important, something. This is why I joined the web development program at Bloomtech where I 
  learned the skills to make a career that could help make a difference.`]
